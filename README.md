The **Jazz Trio Database** is a dataset composed of about 45 hours of jazz performances annotated by an automated signal processing pipeline. For more information, [check out the docs](https://huwcheston.github.io/Jazz-Trio-Database/) or our paper published in [Transactions of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval](https://doi.org/10.5334/tismir.186).

## Dataset
 
To download or build the JTD annotations from source, [read the relevant page of our docs](https://huwcheston.github.io/Jazz-Trio-Database/installation/getting-started.html). Audio recordings (both mixed and unmixed) can be found on [this Zenodo record](https://zenodo.org/records/13828030). Access must be requested before JTD audio can be downloaded, and will only be granted to valid research projects. Please provide as much detail relating to how you hope to use JTD when requesting access to the audio.

## License
