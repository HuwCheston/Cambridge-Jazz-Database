# Database Structure
(database-structure)=

After downloading or building the database, you'll end up with an individual directory for each track in the database. The filename is constructed in the form `bandleader-trackname-musician1musician2-year-mbzid`. Names are given in the format `surnamefirstinitial`, e.g. Bill Evans would become `evansb`. In most cases, the bandleader is the pianist, and `musician1musician2` are the bassist and drummer, respectively. In cases where another musician was the bandleader, the pianist always takes priority in the ordering of names.

Inside each directory are the following files:
- `*_onset.csv` files: contain the raw onsets for `piano`, `bass`, and `drums`, with one onset per line;
- `beats.csv`: contain the onsets matched to each beat, as well as the estimated metre and downbeats, with one beat per line;
- `piano_midi.mid`: contains the automatically transcribed piano midi;
- `metadata.json`: contains (surprisingly) track and recording metadata.

## Recording metadata

The metadata files contain the following fields for every recording:
